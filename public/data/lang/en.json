            "description": "<h3>Search</h3><p> The primary task that we are trying to solve is choosing the best medical institution. To do this, we have designed a multi-tier search mechanism by several variables in our system. Any participant can find a specialist, an institution or a service corresponding to his or her specific request.</p><p>We offer several dimensions of search for the required specialist:</p><ul> <li> <i class='fas fa-check '></i> Search by geolocation (for clients looking for clinics nearby) </li> <li> <i class='fas fa-check '></i> Search by field (for clients choosing the best price-quality ratio) </li> <li> <i class='fas fa-check '></i> Search by name of the institution or the doctor (an intuitive search through the entire database of specialists; such clients usually come upon the recommendation or want to check someone's reputation) </li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Search by the list of services provided</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Search by formulary</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Search by symptoms (under development)</li></ul><p> Filtration parameters are available in each section of the website for more accurate delivery of results.</p><br /><h3>Rating</h3><p> Rating is the second important factor in a clinic selection, so we stick to several rules in its compilation.</p><p> Rating of a medical institution, a doctor or a pharmacy is formed on the basis of rates given by a patient in his or her review. The user can add reviews to the system only after the execution of the smart contract for booking. It rules out the possibility of adding fake reviews.</p><p> We made adding a review of the visit and the quality of service of a particular specialist or a clinic mandatory for a patient after each visit in order to increase the rating relevance.</p><p>Overall rating of a doctor is divided into 4 components:</p><ul> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Specialist's knowledge</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Practical skills</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Care about the patient</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Value for money.</li></ul><p>Rating of the institution is formed based on:</p><ul> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Accessibility</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Quality of service</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Cleanliness</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Value for money.</li></ul><p>Pharmacy rating is formed based on:</p><ul> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Quality of service</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Value for money.</li></ul><p> The rating system generates healthy competition and encourages specialists and institutions to fight for the loyalty of each patient. This results in a higher quality of services provided.</p><p> A decentralized user community guarantees honest feedback. As a result, institutions benefit from providing highly qualified services with personal respect to the patient.</p><p> In order to rule out institutions with a dubious reputation, we use a mechanism that excludes a clinic or a pharmacological business from the network if its rating falls below the threshold value. If a clinic or a pharmacy is excluded, it will not be able to apply for a partnership within 1 year. This mechanism will serve as another incentive for medical institutions to provide only high-quality services and customer treatment. After one year, the excluded medical institution may reapply for participation in the system. This term is set because this time is often enough for a complete replacement of the institution’s personnel, and the new team can declare themselves with a fresh start.</p><p> Any action of the medical employee can affect the rating of the entire institution in the future, which generally encourages the system participants to reach a new level of the quality of services and thereby reduce the risk of fatal errors due to negligence.</p><p> Medical institutions participating in insurance programs and fundraising programs for needy people get extra points to their rating. This scheme is introduced with a view to attracting as many partners as possible to the active financial model of settlements for the provision of medical services within the system.</p><br /><h3>Booking</h3><p>Once the user has made a decision about the clinic and/or the doctor, he or she can:</p><ul> <li> <i class='fas fa-check '></i> Select a convenient date from the specific specialist’s schedule and make an appointment </li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Reserve money for the provision of service/services</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> Once the booking and appointment time are confirmed by the clinic, the system forms a smart contract for the provision of services and generates a record in the personal calendar in the user's Personal Account</li> <li><i class='fas fa-check '></i> After the services were provided, the patient can confirm the transfer of MedPoints™ points to the clinic account via a mobile app or website right in the clinic.</li></ul><p> If necessary, the medical institution can additionally request access to medical records of the patient. It is up to the patient to decide which records to disclose.</p><p> We are going to encourage payments with MPT points by providing a flexible bonus system, including discounts for repeated visits to a particular institution and special price offers from the partners of the system.</p><br /><h3>Payment system</h3><p> The problem of availability of convenient and reliable payment tools is particularly acute in regard to transnational settlements. Inflation, correlation of exchange rates and domestic regulators aggravate the problem.</p><p> Bitcoin and blockchain have already proved that they can help solve this problem. So far, there are 1,500+ digital currencies, each having advantages and drawbacks.</p><p>MedPoints™ has its own payment unit – an MPT point equal to the cognominal token.</p><p>Specifics of MPT:</p><ul> <li> <i class='fas fa-check '></i> No fixed fee; the fee is calculated automatically depending on the amount of data transmitted </li> <li> <i class='fas fa-check '></i> High transaction speed secured by so-called 'ranges' – services are paid only after the smart contract execution, which, in turn, may include several sessions of balance refill and payments for the clinic’s services. </li></ul><p> Each component of the network, including the website, app and software for medical institutions, has built-in wallets that display not only the user balance, but also the entire history of transactions in real time.</p><br /><h3>Digitization of medical records</h3><p> The MedPoints™ system allows patients to digitize and keep medical records in any format.</p><p> Data encryption at all stages guarantees that only the records owner has full access to them, which is an indispensable condition for ensuring privacy and security of documents stored.</p><p>Each record is part of a distributed ledger and cannot be altered or tampered with.</p><p> Various medical organizations can request access to the patient's medical chart. The patient can allow to access either the entire medical chart or a limited number of records. Coupled with the ability to set the time access limits for specific organizations, this tool provides each patient a wide range of functions for managing his or her digitized medical records.</p><p> The system automatically converts the uploaded files in png and jpg/jpeg formats. Converted images weigh a lot less than the source images, which positively affects the cost of digitizing and encourages patients to upload as much data from their medical records as possible.</p>"

During the time when each of us was engaged in parallel projects, we managed to take a break (in a good way) from MedPoints and look at many aspects of the system in a new way.<br /><br />We have identified some minor bugs in the system and improved usability of the site. We also worked on the localization of the platform and fixed some moments in the user’s part.<br /><br />The current “Bull Run” in the cryptocurrency market today allows us to spend more time working on a project that we consider the whole team to be one of the most significant in our career. We hope that you will find it interesting and you will support us at the stage of development and development of the system."
